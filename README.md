# CS-465-Portfolio

*Architecture:*
*Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?*

  I definitely have the most expierience working with express HTML, I feel pretty comfortable with it. I think that it's a pretty good, relatively simple way to design a website. It's a tried and true classic, but definitely not the most efficient option or best for complex or data-heavy projects. I have a bit of experience with Javascript, but this was my first time using handlebars. I like it a lot! I want to practice actually creating the shortcuts on my own more to become more familiar with the syntax, but I think it's great for templates you'll be using multiple times! I found working on the single-page application to be a bit more challenging. It's very interesting! I can see how, once you're familiar with it, it could definitely help create a better, more efficient website. I struggled a little bit with properly nesting my files in order to make everything actual function. Again, this is something I will be practicing more on my own in the future.
  
*Functionality:*
*How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.*



*Testing:*
*Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.*



*Reflection:*
*How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?*

  While I have some experience working with most of the individual components we used in this class, I didn't really have a good concept of how they all fucntion together. This class did a good job of showing me how they all interact with each other, how to properly implement them and use them together, and what areas I need more work in. I really enjoyed this class, I found it to be a good challenge! Something that I've learned from this claass is that if I want to describe myself on a resume as a full-stack developer, I definitely need more practice actually making software from start to finish and not just theoretical knowledge of how the individual components should work.
