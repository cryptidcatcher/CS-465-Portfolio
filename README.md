# CS-465-Portfolio

*Architecture:*
*Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?*

  I definitely have the most expierience working with express HTML, I feel pretty comfortable with it. I think that it's a pretty good, relatively simple way to design a website. It's a tried and true classic, but definitely not the most efficient option or best for complex or data-heavy projects. I have a bit of experience with Javascript, but this was my first time using handlebars. I like it a lot! I want to practice actually creating the shortcuts on my own more to become more familiar with the syntax, but I think it's great for templates you'll be using multiple times! I found working on the single-page application to be a bit more challenging. It's very interesting! I can see how, once you're familiar with it, it could definitely help create a better, more efficient website. I struggled a little bit with properly nesting my files in order to make everything actual function. Again, this is something I will be practicing more on my own in the future.
  
*Functionality:*
*How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.*

Javascript is a proper full fledged programming language, while JSON is a universal "language" used for data transfer. JSON ties the frontend and backend together with a standardized format of communication. JSON only stores data, it can't be used to create functions or executable logic. JSON has stricter rules syntactically, while Javascript is more flexible. Because JSON is language independant, it's able to be parsed by lots of different coding languages. Reusable UI components can make your code smoother and more efficient, and save you lots of time and effort. They also make it easier to adapt and refractor your code.

*Testing:*
*Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.*

Endpoints are the specific urls in a webpage that get incoming requests and return a response. Methods are actions the client is performing (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.) Methods and enedpoints work together to manage the data flow between frontend and backend. Security is crucial, and it's important to have layered security, or there's lots of gaps where bad actors could potentially hack your software. Authentication and authorization can be used to verify who the user is and what they should be able to access. Data encryption can prevent unauthorized access, and input validation reduces risk of common attacks like data injection or cross-site scripting. API testing is where you send various requests to endpoints and validate their responses to make sure that everything is stable, functioning correctky, and protected from vulnurabilities.

*Reflection:*
*How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?*

  While I have some experience working with most of the individual components we used in this class, I didn't really have a good concept of how they all function together. This class did a good job of showing me how they all interact with each other, how to properly implement them and use them together, and what areas I need more work in. I really enjoyed this class, I found it to be a good challenge! Something that I've learned from this class is that if I want to describe myself on a resume as a full-stack developer, I definitely need more practice actually making software from start to finish and not just theoretical knowledge of how the individual components should work.
